# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). Each URL is tied to a specific user, and only that user has the ability to modify the URL. We use conventional cookie encryption to track user sessions, and password hashing to secure the accounts.
